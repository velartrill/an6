	<p>Jane! Honestly, what does it <em>take</em> to get you to write? I didn’t even hear from you last Christmas! I had to find out about your promotion from the newspaper. The <em>newspaper!</em></p>

<p>Don’t you “national security” me, young woman!</p>

<p>And don’t take that tone with your sister. You’re both grown women, there’s absolutely no need for these theatrics.</p>

<p>Now that’s just not fair! I wanted to tell you, but — I know how much you loved your father, it would have destroyed you both. But he — well, he was always away on duty, and a woman has needs, you know!</p>

<p>Oh, like you’ve never been drugged and tied to a chair before.</p>

<p><em>Jane!</em> I know you never approved of my business, but that is simply uncalled for! He was a very decent fellow, taught little Anna here how to drive a getaway car and bullseye a moving target from sixty paces with nothing but a — oh, I’m sorry, darling, Clarice, I know I shouldn’t still be thinking of you by your old name but you’ll always be my little girl to me, you know!</p>

<p>Of course I know who she is, sweetheart! She may live under a South American volcano but she actually <em>writes</em> her dear old mother, unlike <em>some</em> people I could mention! She told me all about how you rescued that poor journalist from a nest of razortooth shrieklings — <em>two years ago!</em> Honestly.</p>

<p>Oh, and not to mention “Operation Golden Peacock!” Do you know <em>where</em> I learned my daughter was a national hero? In the middle of the Sonoran desert in a coke deal gone wrong, that’s where! I’m on the ground behind a trailer clutching a submachine gun, bullets flying all around, and Pedro — your dear uncle Pedro, he wishes you’d visit him more, you know — he tells me, “oh, it’s just like that dust-up little Jane had back in Arkansas, you know,” and I say to him, I said, <em>“what</em> dust-up? I never heard about this!” and then he had to tell me all about how you singlehandedly wiped out a Spetsnaz safehouse with nothing but an empty Kalashnikov and a bottle of vodka <em>while I was helping Pamela load the rocket launcher!</em> You remember Pamela, don’t you, dear? She used to take you horse-riding when you were little? She would so dearly love to see you all grown up, you know!</p>

<p>I know you have a busy life, but is it really so hard just to give your mother a call every now and then? At least when your <em>sister</em> secretly toppled the government of Chile and replaced the president with a puppet to further her elaborate schemes, she had the good grace to tell her mother about it! I just want to know what’s going on in my daughters’ lives, you know?</p>

<p>Now. You two. I want you to stop arguing about who framed who and hug and make up, understand? An— Clarice, untie your sister right this instant. We’re still a family, and—</p>

<p><em>Girlfriend!?</em> You have a <em>girlfriend?</em> And when was I going to find out? You never even thought to bring her by and say hello to your old mother? I love you, Jane, I do, but you can be so inconsiderate, you know? You! With the mustache and prison tattoos — go fetch my daughter’s <em>girlfriend</em> right this very moment, I’ve had enough of this nonsense. We’re all going to sit down and have dinner as a family and get to know each other, even if it kills us! Now Jessie — or is it Penny, I’m sorry, my dear, I can never remember — come along, you’re going to help me make us a nice apple pie for desert. No ifs, ands, or buts, young lady!</p>

<p>Goodness gracious, young people these days!</p>
