<p>RICHMOND, VA — FBI! <em>Freeze!</em></p>

<p>I said <em>freeze!</em> You're under arrest, all of you!</p>

<p>Yeah, <em>especially</em> you! You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law.</p>

<p>Just where do you think <em>you're</em> going?</p>

<p>Uh-huh. Get on the ground.</p>

<p>And you. Don't even think about it. We've got snipers across the street and men at every exit. Oh, don't look so surprised, I know exactly what you pulled in Juarez. Unlike the Federales, I did my damn homework.</p>

<p>Really? Then would you should have no trouble explaining the box of fake IDs we found under the loose floorboard in your penthouse. Great view, by the way. Even better <em>Playboy</em> collection.</p>

<p>What, this warrant? Yeah, we found your pet judge. And all those bank transfers to the Caymans. I've got two words for you, kid: <em> state's evidence.</em></p>

<p>Honestly. How dumb do you think I am?</p>

<p>Don't answer that.</p>

<p>What, nothing to say for yourself, Jessie? Or Miranda, or Juanita, or whatever the hell you're calling yourself these days? Well, first time for everything, I guess.</p>

<p>Yeah, Lucio, <em>that</em> Miranda. Did you have any idea who you were getting in bed with? Or did your sister's life really mean so little to you?</p>

<p>Funny you should mention that. Bianchi cleared out her safe deposit box this morning and booked a flight to Venezuela under an assumed name. But don't worry, we've already got agents in Denver ready to collar her when she makes her connection. She's not pulling you of the fire this time.</p>

<p>All right, all right, get these idiots in a squad car. I'll wrap up here. Good work, boys.</p>

<p>God damn, MacReady. We got them. We finally got them.</p>

<p>Kind of hard to believe it's finally over, isn't it? You tell those sneaky sons of bitches at Langley drinks are on me. Maria can finally have some closure.</p>

<p>…wait a second.</p>

<p>I still count twenty of ours on scene. Who the <em>hell</em> was driving that car!? Marcus! Pull traffic cam footage right now!</p>

<p>Dammit! I knew something was wrong. They're headed out of the city. I need roadblocks on Old Lee and Country Hill, now now <em>now!</em></p>

<p>Wait. Marcus, hold that frame. Zoom in on the driver's seat. I'd swear to god she looked familia—</p>

<p><em><strong>Bianchi!?</strong></em></p>

<p><small><em>Once a small-town detective, Special Agent Jane Pearson is now one of the Bureau's most decorated agents. Recuited after preventing a heist on Clandestine Research Facility #████ that could have left the Zeta Device in the hands of the North Koreans, Agent Pearson has a reputation for cracking open the Bureau's most intractable cold cases. She lives in Washington, D.C. with her pet rottweiler Andy.</em></small></p>
