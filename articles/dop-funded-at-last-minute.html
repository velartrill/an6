       <div class="headline">Federal Department of Pain Funded At Last Minute</div><div class="byline">Josephine Sacher-Masoch, 25 March 2015</div><p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Federal Department of Pain, which was facing a 
midnight shutdown last night as its funding looked set to expire, has 
been fully funded for the remainder of the fiscal year after an 
emergency bill was passed by the Senate just before midnight.</p>

<p>The bill to fund the Department of Pain had been held up in committee 
for several months, and while it looked set to pass the Senate without 
incident yesterday, voting was complicated by the flooded the Senate 
chamber yesterday morning. Janitorial and security staff were unable to 
disperse the rainstorm and minor flooding occurred on the National Mall 
during the incident, causing a small amount of property damage.</p>

<p>Allegations emerged later in the day that the Senate rainstorm was 
not natural weather, but had in fact been inflicted upon the Senate by 
the cloud spirits for some terrible transgression against them. A brief 
investigation by Senate leadership seemed to implicate Sen. Rand Paul 
(R-KY), who strenuously denied any guilt.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, pressure grew on Sen. Paul throughout the day to 
perform a ritual of appeasement to the cloud spirits. While Paul 
initially refused, he relented after the Secretary of Pain, Madeleine 
Schaeffer, requested a special meeting with the senator just before 
midnight.</p>

<p>Sen. Paul gave an unprepared statement to the press after the 
meeting. Outside the DOP’s Washington offices, and unable to stand 
without the support of two staffers, a visible battered and bleeding 
Paul explained that the Secretary of Pain had been “very convincing.” He 
added, his voice shaky and faltering, that the ritual of appeasement 
should not be seen as an admission of any guilt, and repeated his 
innocence of “any crime” against the cloud spirits. “I did nothing,” 
Paul mumbled, again and again, until his staffers gently ushered him 
into a waiting car. “Nothing. I did nothing.”</p>

<p>After the ritual was performed, the rainstorm finally abated, and 
janitorial staff were able to clear the Senate chamber in time to 
assemble an emergency session. The bill to fund the Department of Pain 
passed by unanimous consent, averting what analysts predicted would have 
been an “extremely costly” shutdown.</p>

<p>“Most people don’t realize that the Department of Pain is directly 
responsible for nearly 40% of all suffering nationwide in a typical 
week,” explained Dr. Daniel Andronikov, a pain scientist at Oregon State 
University. “Without funding, the DOP couldn’t arrange to have your desk 
reorganized to make sure you’d get the maximum number of papercuts, or 
sabotage bicycles to cause crippling, life-changing accidents for those 
who need them most.”</p>

<p>“Most of the time, when you think ‘Department of Pain,’ you think of 
the underground discipline chambers the DOP operates, to kidnap and 
torture completely innocent citizens more or less at random,” Dr. 
Andronikov added, “and while this is a very important function, less 
than 10% of the department’s operational budget goes towards maintaining 
the electrode arrays and table straps used to physically and 
psychologically break random citizens whose only crime was being in the 
wrong place at the wrong time.”</p>

<p>Dr. Andronikov is relieved the shutdown has been averted. “A DOP 
shutdown is a nightmare scenario for most communities,” he explains. 
“What is life without suffering? Can pleasure ever be truly known when 
not balanced by pain?”</p>
